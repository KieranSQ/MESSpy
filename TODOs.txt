###################################################### work in progress...
### version 1.0
# togliere vettori inutile che si possono calcolare a posteriori (es. self.consumption)
# inserire bilanci input output singole tech
# economic assessment
    # add not float electricity price (series)
    # add redistribution of REC incentives
# add battery ageing 
# update / totally rewrite Electolyzer and Fuel cell modells 
# general production from .csv? Usefull f.i for wind production

### TO SPPED UP
# parametric anlysis and optimizations
    # don't recreate REC object every time but change only the parameter of interest and then resimulate the REC
        # use REC.reset() 
    # don't resimulate REC object if the parameter of interest is an economic one
# Casching
    # pvlib standardised serie (it changes only is a PV parameter different from Ppeak changes)
    # load
    # reference_case
# if every year is the same, f.i without battery aging
    # simulate only one year and duplicate it for the economic analysis
# parallelizations of locationss that can be solved simultaneously

### version 1.0S (for students)
# .exe
# input from yaml/jason/xml
# instruction
# idea: ask them to find load info, give them only balances without economic analysis. 

### version 2.0 and following
# HP Guglielmo
# enviromental analysis
# add new logic to simulate smart batteries and collective batteries (single location needs information of entire REC, simulation order?)
# graphic and web interface
# add gas and heat/cool components ...
# add warming.py
# add test.py
# different timestep? (collective self-consumption is defined by law on an hourly basis)
