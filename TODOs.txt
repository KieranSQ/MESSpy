- economic assessment
   - add redistribution of REC incentives
- general production from .csv
  Useful f.i. for wind production

  Francesco's model?
- simple tech models
	- heat pump and cooling
	  COP = f(T)
	- simple natural gas boiler
	  efficiency
	- gas turbine
	  characteristic curve
	- internal combustion engine
	  characteristic curve
	- electric boiler
	  efficiency
- parametric anlysis and optimizations
  - don't recreate REC object every time but change only the parameter of interest and then resimulate the REC
    use REC.reset() 
  - don't resimulate REC object if the parameter of interest is an economic one
- if every year is the same, f.i without battery aging
  - simulate only one year and duplicate it for the economic analysis
- add new logic to simulate smart batteries and collective batteries (single location needs information of entire REC, simulation order?)
- fare testing delle funzioni
- timestep 15 min

For students
- .exe
- instruction
- idea: ask them to find load info, give them only balances without economic analysis. 

Futuristic suggestions:
- Caching
  - pvlib standardised serie (it changes only is a PV parameter different from Ppeak changes)
  - load
  - reference_case
- parallelizations of locations that can be solved simultaneously
- HP Guglielmo
- enviromental analysis
- graphic and web interface
- add warning.py (?)
